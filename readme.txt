Rotary Encoder
=====================
This release [R2] contains the added functionality of reading data from the temperature sensor
and display it on the OLED.

The project makes use of code from the following library projects:
- CMSISv1p30_LPC13xx : for CMSIS 1.30 files relevant to LPC13xx
- MCU_Lib            : for LPC13xx peripheral driver files
- EaBaseBoard_Lib    : for Embedded Artists LPCXpresso Base Board peripheral drivers

These library projects must exist in the same workspace in order
for the project to successfully build.
